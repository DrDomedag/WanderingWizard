General things to do:

...sound

Same-world teleporter tiles.

The "wait" action should give one "recovery turn" to a random spell per action used.
Refill all spell slots when there are no enemies in active tiles as a QoL thing.
Use the 'mazetest.py' algorithm to make a cave biome (good for tunnels) - combine with noise for irregularly shaped chambers.
Could make the cave biome 'generate_tile' be a lot more aggressive, generating a larger area.

Use Perlin noise and make the high and low values walls and the mid values floors to make snakey caves.
This works really well with the tile-by-tile generation.


Create "fear" status effect that causes enemies to flee, make trolls suffer it when they take fire damage.

Make multicoloured text. ChatGPT had a suggestion that didn't seem horrible.

Use the desaturation thing to make and show a Petrified status effect.

Add a "has noticed player" boolean to monsters. If False, at the beginning of act(),
check if player within certain range (representing hearing) or within LoS, or if ally within range is flagged as true.
If not, skip turn.

Determine whether spells should pass themselves or their caster as the source to on_damage, on_heal type things.
If they *always* pass themselves, you can always go spell.caster, *but* not all effect sources have a caster.
Porque no los dos? "source" and "caster", and if "caster" is none, don't do that kind of thing.

Create more visual effects.
Create projectile visual effect.


Biome plan:
Give harder biomes a bias of arctan(x-a)-1.5 where x is the tile and a is the minimum distance it should spawn at.



Things that are 'implemented' but do not currently work:

For some inexplicable reason, walking into a portal by clicking on it moves you one tile off target in the other world,
but clicking on the far side of the portal or using the keyboard, you land on target.
This is in spite of the fact that both use the world.move_player(target) function.

Unsure whether it's an issue, but LoS display could get weird if wall in tiles you have seen previously are destroyed.



Spell upgrades!
Types:
Iterations (raw stat buffs)
Innovations (upgrades that change how a spell works)

Iterations are found as loot on powerful enemies and apply to spells of a specific school
E.g. "Blood Damage iteration" which can be slotted (permanently) into a Blood spell and increases its Damage stat.
School specific iterations, like "number of targets" for Lightning or "Life drain" for Blood

Innovations are bought with points found in specific PoIs and more fundamentally alter how a spell works.
E.g. adding a damage type, making a spell distinguish friend from foe.

How:
    Add a thing to cast() that gets the final stats and passes them to on_cast()
    It gets relevant stats and edits them for each modifier.
    In order:
        Spell upgrades
        Innovations
        Iterations
        Items
        Passive skills
