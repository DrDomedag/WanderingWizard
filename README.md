# Wandering Wizard
This is a game inspired heavily by [Rift Wizard 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058570/Rift_Wizard_2/). It's currently in an early stage of development. You can try it out by running main.py, though there is no requirements.txt, so you'll have to install the necessary packages manually. There is also no tutorial, nor is making one a priority, but the game is primarily mouse controlled, and I think you can figure it out.

Click the spells in the left-hand menu or use the scroll wheel to select one.
Hold down the right mouse button to see the possible target tiles and area of effect of the selected spell. Click a legal target tile to cast.
Use the numpad keys or left click the ground to move.

The Wizard finds themselves beset by goblins right at the border between the plains and forest biomes. They are considering taking out some of the closest ones with a Lightning Bolt spell. (The books on the ground are debug items that teach the Wizard a random spell.)

![In the face of a second group of goblins approaching from the east, the wizard has decided to raise skeletal allies - an excellent choice given their resistance to the piercing attacks of the goblin spears. Additionally, they have use the Arcane Lesson spell to give these skeletons a magical bolt attack strong enough to kill any goblin in one hit - as long as the trolls that also live in the forest do not show up, these should turn the tide of battle. The right area of the screen shows the statistics of whatever the mouse is hovering over - right now one of the empowered skeletons.](/misc/ss2.png)

After cleaning up the goblins, the wizard decides to explore the plains. They come upon a fenced-off stone building with what appears to be a graveyard. Will the Wizard step up to the door to open it, risking finding themselves in the thick of an ambush, or will they spend spell charges to blast it open from afar?
