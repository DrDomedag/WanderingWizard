General things to do:
Fix hover so that you get info on spells and not tiles when hovering over menu items (left side in particular).
Add more entity info (like remaining duration, attributes, passive and active abilities with mouseovers) to right side menu.

Verify bug level of spellbook pickups. Seemed like they didn't give the right tier.
Figure out why disks (Seismic Jolt) are so laggy.

...sound

Doors!
Teleporter tiles that just bring you somewhere nearby, or to a paired tile.
PoIs
The "wait" action should give one "recovery turn" to a random spell per action used.
Use the 'mazetest.py' algorithm to make a cave biome (good for tunnels) - combine with noise for irregularly shaped chambers.

Implement a goblin shaman or something that casts Raise Longdead.

Consider implementing *another* dict that remembers tiles you have seen to make FoW not regenerate. Update the show_los function to use this.

Figure out why Seismic Jolt is *so slow* when Poison Mist isn't.

Things that are 'implemented' but do not currently work:


Pushing entities still doesn't work.
Visual effects still do not work.   <---- IMPORTANT
